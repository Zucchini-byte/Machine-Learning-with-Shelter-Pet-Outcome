I made this for my local science fair

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data, which was obtained from the Austin Animal Shelter.

dataPrep.py is used to prepare and format the dataset

modelTraining.py implements sklearn python library to train a model using the data I prepared.

All the graphs and data are stored in the data directory.
